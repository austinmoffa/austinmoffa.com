<h1>Music</h1>
Among other things, I like to make music in my free time. I've released two albums under the name ROZKOL. The music is a mix of industrial, noise, and dark ambient sounds.
I've released it under the Creative Commons Attribution license, which means other creators can use it in any way they see fit in their own projects.<br>
The albums are available on my bandcamp page which you can get to below, or at <a href='http://freemusicarchive.org/music/ROZKOL'>Free Music Archive</a> where both albums combined have had over 40k listens.
