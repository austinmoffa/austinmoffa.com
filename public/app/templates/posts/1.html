    <h1>In Praise of <i>In Praise of Idleness</i>, a reflection on Rutger Bregman's <i>Utopia for Realists</i></h1>
    I'm in the middle of Rutger Bregman's <i>Utopia for Realists</i> and it's making me equal parts optimistic and self-conscious. The book argues that we have reached such a state of mutual prosperity that our previous visions of utopia have essentially been realized. That is, of course, not to say that on an individual level that we no longer have short-term needs or desires but that as a (global) society we lack the coherent and lofty "aspiration" which inspired previous generations. We have ascended to the very peak and are left not knowing what challenge to next tackle - in essence we can only think in terms of "more of the same."<br>
    Money. More money. Of course that's the goal implicit in any metric of contemporary wellness. The dollar has become not only the unit of success, but its ever inflating figure the assurance and measurement of progress. This assumption that "value" can only ever be discussed in terms of monetary impact is an unfortunate and deplorable result of rampant sociopath-style capitalism that permeates the worst aspects of our society (think <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i> or, if you're my age, of your student loan providers.)
    I would like to further examine this line of thinking, but before doing so I must relate the following: it has been observed by journalists and amateur sociologists beyond count that there is something wrong with the younger generation. There is a malaise, a lack of enthusiasm for the tasks which they are made to do to earn their living. I have written before on Bertrand Russell's <i>In Praise of Idleness</i>, but once more for good measure I share his words:
<blockquote>Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish forever.</blockquote>
Bregman masterfully reinforces this thought in his book, even backing it up with piles of figures and charts for the perpetually skeptic, but what's interesting is that he takes it a step further. Not only does he condemn the notion that we still need the 40 hour work week, but he goes so far as to label many (or most) of the jobs which we have invented to fill the void of the time intensive labor economy, quite simply, as "bullshit jobs." I am delighted by the blunt appraisal.<br>
    19th century Russian literature is among my personal favorites when it comes to academic reading. It provides a wonderful look at a culture in a state of perpetual flux - citizens of a country that lacked a unified narrative (and in fact had several conflicting ones). I would not suggest that United States itself is quite as fractured in terms of cultural identity, but I do think there are obvious parallels and lessons to be learned in studying cultures that have undergone such intentional and drastic shifts - and besides that, it's damned good reading. <br>
    A staple of fiction from that era (and not exclusive to the Russian variety) was the livelihood and leisure of the aristocratic ruling class. Leisure was their right, exclusively their domain, and as such it seems no strange coincidence that many of the "classics" concern aristocrats and the strange contrivances they conjure to fill their otherwise empty schedules. In fact, I am reminded most immediately of the novel <i>Crome Yellow</i> by Aldous Huxley, the entire premise of which is a gathering of a group of well-off scholars and layabouts who spend a summer lazing on the estate of a an aristocrat. This was the age of poets, authors, artists, and scholars - all of which, now, are unsurprisingly looked down upon due to the lack of material contribution (with the exception of the likes of Stephen King or pop stars who have both the talent for creative ventures as well as the business sense to make vast sums of money to offset the otherwise unseemly lifestyle.) 
    Now I know the very word "aristocracy" is enough to summon a sense of disgust in an American (even if he or she could not quite explain why this feeling exists, or what an aristocrat is) but it should come as little surprise that we descendants of the peasant-class have nothing but disdain for the privileged and their wasteful habits and interests - yet it is also readily apparent that the virtue of industriousness and pursuit of work over individual desires is an intentional manifestation of the power of the ruling class.  How, then, does it come to be that it somehow still pervades the deepest sources of our identity?<br>
    My conclusion is that this generation which we are so quick to label with our deepest scorn (laziness) are actually not lazy, but instead are rightfully starting to develop a skepticism of this "moral" grounding meant to keep them monetarily productive and intellectually inert. In other words, they're starting to smell the "bullshit," and unlike previous generations are not content to continue merely trudging in the trough (in spite of the best efforts of monetary institutions to smother them and their interests in crushing financial burden.) <br>
    Thus, this perceived "laziness" is only a symptom, the cause (as identified by philosophers and re-stated by Bregman) is that when you take away "industrious" and "productive" as sources of identity, we are left with little else to replace it - no other means to derive value for our very existence. It is infinitely easier to label and insult than it is to spend time critically re-evaluating the essence of the system from which you've to that point derived you whole purpose of being, and as such many are forced into spending more time that they ought to (at least 40 hours a week) doing work that doesn't really need to be done.<br>
    Bregman believes that a basic income would go a long way towards not only alleviating the malaise of "bullshit" work, but also towards bettering society as a whole. When removing the bigger paycheck as the impetus for our existence, we become free to follow more intellectual and socioculturally beneficial pursuits (such as research, teaching, or even those ever-dreaded arts.)<br>
    Naturally, the counter-argument is that without mandating a need for (bullshit) work, people simplyâ€¦ wouldn't. I encourage you to read Bregman's book to find all the studies and examples that show that not to be the case (and that, in fact, in all cases where a basic income had been implemented through history the beneficiaries lives were improved in more or less every observable metric, and beyond that these studies actually show a positive economic impact.)<br>
    I don't think we're likely to live in a world free of the need for bullshit work anytime soon, and quite clearly neither does Bregman, but he encourages us to dream of and discuss it all the same. Such changes are unlikely to have a major effect for us, but by developing these ideals now we are growing the lexicon for future generations to discuss these same issues. Perhaps it is time to stop being content to label malcontents as "lazy" and instead ask them what is that they do value, if it not hard work - and indeed to ask ourselves that very same question. Perhaps it's time to ask: "what <i>should</i> we value?"
