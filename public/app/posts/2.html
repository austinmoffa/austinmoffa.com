<h1>Solving the "Millennial" Enigma</h1> 
<p >The average
millennial is a skittish creature. Existing in simultaneous and
contradictory states of self-doubt and overwhelming egotism, to
capture their ever tumultuous attention span requires awareness and
cunning. It is my sincere hope that in writing this I can help
elucidate basic tenants and techniques that may aid in getting the
most of your burgeoning workforce.</p>
<p >

</p>
<p >Whereas prior
generations have been able to enter the workforce innately aware of
the responsibilities and duties their new vocations necessitate, the
millennial has been found profoundly lacking in this trait. As such
you may find it necessary at times to sit them aside and transfer
your knowledge to them. This process is known as &ldquo;teaching&rdquo;
(of which you are likely unfamiliar, yourself having come out of
college or even high school fully formed and prepared for the
esoteric business logic that awaited you and thus never having needed
such coddling.) You may find this process to be slow and laborious,
but at no point are you to let yourself feel at fault for this. Your
methodologies are perfect, honed through years of experience. Know
that your millennial has likely never had to perform actual work
before, and as such it will take many months or years for them to
reach your level of expertise, if at all. Again, this is not your
fault, for the millennial is a slovenly creature unaccustomed to
adversity.</p>
<p >

</p>
<p >You may find after a
time that your young employee will start grow disenchanted with the
mind-distressingly repetitive tasks you've provided to them. You may
have read several articles that claim the millennial is motivated more
sincerely by a love for the task they are performing than by money,
so at this point it would be wise to quickly begin adding
responsibilities while offering no or meager wage increases. This
provides the millennial with a sense of intrinsic worth and belonging.
Rest assured, should they for some reason grow disenchanted with the
work you have them doing, their crippling student loan debt and the
horrid job market is likely to keep them with you for many years to
come.</p>
<p >

</p>
<p >Should you find
these methodologies to be insufficient, it might be time to draft a
culturally appropriate forward thinking mission statement for your
company. Remember, no task no matter how menial or degrading can be
framed in such as a way as to be world-saving. Try to use
environmental or social issues as a framing device. Make small (but
not embarrassingly so) donations to attract publicity while not
off-setting your profit margins. The youthful millennial mind (still
swimming with and corrupted by &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo; and &ldquo;desires&rdquo;)
will easily fall to these ploys, plus, by simultaneous promising
meaningful work and not providing tangible emotional or intellectual
feedback, we create a paradoxical environment where the millennial
will believe he or she is contributing (this satisfying their
internal drive) while not providing a sense of accomplishment. Thus,
their belief in emotionally satisfying work will slowly be eroded and
more monotonous tasks can be assigned.</p>
<p >

</p>
<p >One neat trick we've
found is to implement an &ldquo;open-office&rdquo; environment. In
this system you replace traditional desks and cubicles with tables of
identical work-stations. We've found that this way you can cram
approximately 15% more employees into any given environment, and it
comes with the benefit of the employee having no sense of ownership
or privacy in their workspace (this makes &ldquo;relocating&rdquo;
them substantially easier, should you find them incapable of being
salvaged.) Though this will lead to an overwhelming increase in
visual and auditory stimuli, you're not likely to find a negative
impact on millennial performance as they are incapable of focusing
their attention on a given task for more than a few moments
regardless of external distraction. 
</p>
<p >

</p>
<p >Remember above all
else that the millennial has gone his or her whole life never having
had to feel like a &ldquo;loser,&rdquo; thus it has become your task
to make up the lost time. Make sure to loudly mention their
generational short-comings (or use phrases like &ldquo;participation
trophies&rdquo; and &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; to codify and soften the
message.) A recent article has found that nearly 60% of millennials
have admitted to disliking their own generation &ndash; with hard
work and perseverance I'm sure we can make even more of these young
men and women dislike who they are based on factors in their
up-bringing over which they had no control or awareness.</p>
<p >

</p>
<p >It's important above
all else that we identify and ostracize any traits or behavior that
deviate from our own. The belief in &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; or
&ldquo;purpose&rdquo; in work might severely damage the menial
labor-force, especially as the young become increasingly adept at
finding other ways to maintain their livelihoods. Thus, the few that
willingly subject themselves should appropriately be broken down as
outlined above so that they may spread the nihilistic tendencies of
their detractors. 
</p>
<p >

</p>
<p >The millennial, by
refusing to fit into predefined methodologies and thought-patterns,
is inherently an inferior product to prior generations. They must be
slowly molded into the models of perfection that we ourselves have
become. I know it is absurd for you to think, but many millennials
look at the state of the world and dare to think it could be made
better, as if we have not already reached the pinnacle of human
civilization. Indeed! What absurdity from the minds and mouths of
babes.</p>
