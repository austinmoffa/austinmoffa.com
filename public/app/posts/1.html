<h1>Good God! Why? (AKA, Another Dev Blogger)</h1>
<p>	I've read plenty of authors
say “you have to write for yourself,” but that advice has always
felt wrong to me in a way I couldn't articulate – in a
visceral sense. Part of it might be that I was never much inclined to
write only for myself – that is, when you create something your
inclination is to share it. “Look at what I've birthed!”</p>
<p>	Maybe I've been interpreting
it wrong. The problem is that it can be read as a statement about
authenticity or as one regarding the affirmation of the value of your
work. Interpreting it as “you have to do what you enjoy when it
comes to self-expression” is a far less ambiguous, more agreeable
statement, rather it is the “you have to derive your validation
from the act of creation” that I find intrinsically incorrect. 
</p>
<p>	I had a professor (Dr. James
Roney of Juniata College, for those interested) who introduced me to
the works of a Russian philosopher by the name of Mikhail Bakhtin,
particularly the concept of “dialogism.” To egregiously crib the
wiki definition: 
</p>
<blockquote>For
Bakhtin, all language — indeed, all thought — appears as
dialogical. This means that everything anybody ever says always
exists in response to things that have been said before and in
anticipation of things that will be said in response. In other words,
we do not speak in a 	vacuum. All language (and the ideas which
language contains and communicates) is dynamic, relational and
engaged in a process of endless redescriptions of the world.</blockquote>
<p>This idea tends to frighten
some people in that it negates the concept of an isolated,
inalienable and wholly authentic self. I don't know if it would be
appropriate to use the word “soul” here but it feels right to
some degree, suffice that we use it as an amalgum or stand in for the
“us” from which our personality both originates and exists (in
isolation).</p>
<p>	So in any case, I have come
to believe this producing only for the self is a misguided, arguably
impossible task. You can produce, maybe, from the notion that you
have some idea you want to put forth – but if that is the extent of
your creative process you are, at best, engaging in artistic
masturbation – a monologue that denies others the chance to engage
with your work, and denies yourself the ability to engage in the
great discourse that is civilization. To quote Bakhtin directly:</p>
<blockquote>Monologism,
at its extreme, denies the existence outside itself of another
consciousness with equal rights and equal responsibilities, another 
with equal rights... No response is expected from it that could
change anything in the 	world of my consciousness. Monologue is
finalized and deaf to other’s response, does not expect it and does
not acknowledge in it any force.</blockquote>
<p>Why is it that we've come to
idolize the solitary artists and thinkers, the rebels who are “just
being themselves”, as if they are produced and exist outside of our
realm of interaction. Why do we find it shameful to produce things
with the intent of mass consumption (consider the veritable book factory
Stephen King versus the squinting scholar or brilliant artist who
sits writing brilliant manifestos in a dim, trendy studio apartment). 
It tends to be these people who create solely with the intent of
“spreading a message”, work that intentionally denies the
audience a chance at a dialog, and for that they are the ones who
ought to feel ashamed.</p>
<p>	The internal satisfaction of
creation of your most precious art (whatever form it takes) is and
must remain absolutely hollow in the absence of external sources of
engagement. You will never be challenged. You fail to grow as a
human, and you inherently devalue the worth of other people by
denying them at least a chance of interaction with your thought
(because, after all, you already know it's right or good or
brilliant).</p>
<p>	We are afraid to expose what
we create to others, but why? Often because we fear its rejection, we
know how inadequate our offerings are compared to the great artifacts in the coffer of
human civilization. We are so very afraid that we cannot become
better than we are, and from this fear we are driven to isolate ourselves, doomed to be
proven correct.</p>
